# netlify_site

Purpose: Host a really cool resume site showing off some react/javascript/html/css etc to anyone while just making something cool hopefully. Also keeps me focused and sets a kinda "repository" for the different projects I build and lets me do a kinda "version control" on myself and my own learning. Also, apparently Netlify has a really cool tie-in so it can handle the deploy while I can push changes to GitHub from my local editor (depending on which rig I'm using). Open to suggestions!
